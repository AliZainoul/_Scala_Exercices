# Welcome to Scala Exercises Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Scala exercises covering fundamental concepts and advanced topics. Each exercise is designed to help you practice and master different aspects of Scala programming language. Whether you're new to Scala or looking to deepen your understanding, these exercises provide hands-on learning opportunities.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Types in Scala
- Understanding different data types: `Int`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Double`, etc.
- Working with collections: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Tuple`, etc.
- Handling nullable types: `Option`, `Some`, `None`.
- Defining custom types: `case class`, `sealed trait`, `object`.

### 2. Basic Syntax
- Variable declaration and initialization.
- Control structures: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `match`.
- Pattern matching: Deconstructing data structures.
- Error handling: `Try`, `Catch`, `Throw`.

### 3. Functions
- Declaring functions: `def`, function literals.
- Higher-order functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `fold`.
- Currying and partial application.
- Anonymous functions and lambda expressions.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects: Defining state and behavior.
- Inheritance and traits: Code reuse and composition.
- Method overriding and abstract classes.
- Singleton objects and companion objects.

### 5. Functional Programming
- Immutable data structures: `val` vs `var`.
- Pure functions: Side effects and referential transparency.
- Recursion and tail recursion.
- Function composition and higher-order functions.
